      <p class="raspberrypi">Raspberry Pi foundation is a UK based charity that strives to increase technological skills to people globally. Logic and problem-solving  algorithms are introduced to people willing to learn the technological skills, as they are a part of programming. The Raspberry Pi product is a “low-cost, high-performance” computer that people can use to solve problems, build robots, and automate many different functions. 
        What I love about Raspberry Pi is that they hold so many different free tutorials, especially those tailored for kids. On their website, over 150 tutorials can be found <a class="rasberrypi" href=" https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/ ">here. </a>Raspberry Pi holds an annual conference for educators in any field, wanting to further his or her own technological skills, a conference that is highly sought after and completely free. The foundation is truly a leader in educating people about technology, programming, and giving back to the community.

    <p class = "githubtext">And now I introduce you to GitHub – the world’s leading software development platform. GitHub is home to only 733 employees worldwide, but has 73million software development projects and counting. Founded in 2007, GitHub acts as a cloud service that allows people to store their code or plaintext online. The beauty behind GitHub is that it allows for completely public repositories, which means anyone can see my code if I choose to let that happen. The ability to remain completely open to others on the internet provides a welcome to criticism on coding styles, techniques, and problem solving or debugging. Every software employer will want to see your GitHub profile, test whether you can maneuver GitHub through the terminal, or can follow the structure of someone else’s personal repository. Navigating GitHub can be tough, but GitHub offers so many tutorials and well-explained guides for newcomers. A big part of GitHub is the capability to offer their sharing services to allow the software developer community to contribute to open source software. Mozilla Firefox is an open sourced internet browser, which means that nobody is paid to develop their browser. It is all submitted by volunteers striving for a common goal.</p>
