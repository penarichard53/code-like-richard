<header class="AI">What will AI do for you?<br>AI is more than automation on steroids, it amplifies human innovation</header>

      Joe McKendrick is the author of the article titled, “AI is more than automation on steroids, it amplifies human innovation.” Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a subject that people fear, are confused about, or are excited about. The opening line of the article states that, “Artificial Intelligence has a lot of promising applications…” and it does, however I believe we are too far away from large scale applications. The thesis McKendrick presents to the readers is that AI succeeds in allowing human activity and creativity, moreover, “[AI] needs to be designed accordingly.” I do not believe the AI should be designed in this manner, partially because I am not fond of AI; computers should not be able to take on the role of imitating the human psyche. Restricting the power of computation in cognitive science is fundamental maintain the separation between human and machine. If humanity were to have the tools to recreate the conscious, what would it mean to be alive?<br><br>
In the industry, 85% business executives believe AI “will provide their companies competitive advantage, and 75% believe AI will enable their companies to move into new businesses.” However, of these executives polled, less than 40% have a strategy to utilize or incorporate AI into his or her business practice. The lack of planning may be a result of fear or lack of technology, and as a species, we are not yet capable of using artificial intelligence. McKendrick argues that AI “means new ways of thinking about how things get accomplished, and what people need to do to make this happen.” However, I argue that AI should only be about automating tasks, such as calculations or manual labor. In early December of 2017, a bot was programmed to teach itself chess in as little as 4 hours. The bot beat every opponent, including the leading supercomputer and master chess player. If a machine can achieve this level of superiority, in a strategy game that has been studied for hundreds of years by chess players, to what level of power could a machine be capable of?<br><br>      
McKendrick goes on to say that AI should be made less artificial and more intelligent, to emphasize human like qualities. As a species, we should be questioning the ethics behind such a feat – manufacturing machine to be as human-like as possible. How would we even measure such a task, how do we know if we have gone too far? McKendrick supports the notion that AI will spawn creativity in humans, but at what cost? Today, software developers use programs written in code to problem solve, to sift through raw data and create algorithms best suited for the consumer. Advertisements follow the user around from page to page based off his or her search history, creating a personalized advertising portfolio. The technology behind these advertisements, and other similar manipulations of data, are all created by algorithms. AI is not even at the root of such a problem, but the future of AI should be wary for all. If an algorithm generated by a human can create advertising profiles for specific users, based on a huge number of variables, what will AI be able to tell about us?
