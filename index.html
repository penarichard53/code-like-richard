<h2>About this Site</h2>
	<main>
		<p>My name is Richard Peña and I created this webpage to showcase my programming abilities, integrate my interests, and learn to develeop webpages like this one. I am handcrafting every element of this webpage, and plan to maintain this domain and webpage for the rest of my professional career. Users will be able to join me on my journey as I build upon the page, making improvements and tweaks, as well as provide feedback when the time comes. This webpage will speak to recruiters about my full-stack capabilities once it has been fine tuned.</p>

		<p>I hope to showcase my portfolio in an organized manner, similar to <a href="www.github.com">GitHub</a>, and practice my graphic design. I am also going to use this webpage as a learning device, and will be thrilled to see my progression. I recommend everyone try to build a webpage, it is quite an exciting adventure once you get started.</p>
